# Components

If you want to use the React version of Nexd components,
you can import and use them as shown in the following example:

## Admonitions

```tsx frame="none"
import Admonition from '@/core/components/Admonition';

<Admonition type='info'>This is an info</Admonition>
```

import Admonition from '@/core/components/Admonition';

<Admonition type='info'>This is an info</Admonition>

To check the accepted props for each component, visit its source code in the ./core/components directory of your Nexd project.
The components are designed to be easily understandable and are fully written in TypeScript for complete type safety.

## Custom components

To use components that are not part of Nexd Core, make sure to register
them as MDX components in `mdx-components.ts`, located at the root of your
Nexd project.
