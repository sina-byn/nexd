# Nexd and MDX

Nexd is fully built on top of MDX, offering full support for standard Markdown syntax along with custom components for enhanced functionality.

## Components

### Code Blocks

Code blocks are powered by the rehype expressive code plugin. You can explore more in their documentation: [Expressive Code Docs](https://expressive-code.com/installation/).

{/* prettier-ignore */}
````tsx
```bash frame="none"
npm i <pkg>
```
````

<br />

```bash frame="none"
npm i <pkg>
```

### Admonitions

Admonitions provide callout boxes with five variants: `note`, `tip`, `info`, `warning`, and `danger`.

#### Example

```markdown
:::note
This is a note
:::
```

:::note
This is a note
:::

#### Nested Admonitions

```markdown
::::warning
This is a warning

    :::danger
        This is a dangerous tip
    :::

::::
```

::::warning
This is a warning

    :::danger
        This is a dangerous tip
    :::

::::

### Tabs

Tabs allow switching between multiple components, such as code snippets, UI elements, or different views of content, with only one visible at a time.

````markdown
:::tabs[npm, pnpm, yarn]

```bash frame="none"
npm install <pkg>
```

```bash frame="none"
pnpm install <pkg>
```

```bash frame="none"
yarn add <pkg>
```

:::
````

:::tabs[npm, pnpm, yarn]

```bash frame="none"
npm install <pkg>
```

```bash frame="none"
pnpm install <pkg>
```

```bash frame="none"
yarn add <pkg>
```

:::

### Browser Windows

Browser windows are suitable for displaying code output.

```markdown
:::browser
This is a browser window
:::
```

:::browser
This is a browser window
:::

### Directory Trees

Easily visualize directory structures:

```
::tree[./src/components/layout, Nexd]
```

<br />

::tree[./src/components/layout, Nexd]

If you need to visualize a custom tree instead of an existing directory, feel free to use [`<VirtualTree tree={tree} />`](/docs/components/).

:::info
All these markdown components are also available as [React components](/docs/components), some of which provide more customization through detailed props.
