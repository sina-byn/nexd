# Frontmatter

```mdx
// page.mdx
---
index: 1
title: Title
label: Sidebar Label 
crumb: Breadcrumbs Title

```

- `index` : The item's position within its level in the sidebar.

- `title` : The `document.title` of the page.

- `label` : The display title of the item inside the sidebar.
    - if not provided, it defaults to `title`.
    - If title is also missing, it falls back to the last segment of the file's directory name.

- `crumb` : The item's title inside the Breadcrumbs navigation.
    - Defaults to `label` if available.
    - If label is missing, it falls back to `title`.
    - If neither is provided, it defaults to the last segment of the file's directory name.

This ensures a consistent and structured navigation experience while providing meaningful fallbacks.

## Metadata Support

All metadata fields supported by [Next.js Metadata API](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata) are also supported in the Frontmatter of your documentation files.

Simply define your metadata, and Nexd will automatically handle it for you.

Example Frontmatter:

```mdx
// page.mdx
---
title: "Getting Started"
label: "Quick Start Guide"
description: "Learn how to get started with Nexd."
metadata:
  openGraph:
    title: "Getting Started - Nexd Docs"
    description: "Learn the basics of Nexd in just a few minutes."
  twitter:
    card: "summary_large_image"
    title: "Getting Started - Nexd Docs"
    description: "Kickstart your journey with Nexd!"
---
```

With this setup, your documentation pages will seamlessly integrate with Next.js metadata handling, ensuring proper SEO, social sharing, and structured content.
