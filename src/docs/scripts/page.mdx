# Nexd Scripts

## Nexd Script

`npm run nexd` is a development server wrapper around the [Next.js dev server](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/next#next-dev-options).
It provides additional commands for improved workflow:

- `o` : Open in browser

- `rs` : Restart the dev server

- `cls` : Clear the console

- `.exit` : Exit the dev server

All Next.js dev script options are fully supported. For example:

```bash
// .Terminal
npm run nexd -- --help
```

### Pre-Configuration

To run a pre-configured version of the nexd script, simply add the necessary flags and options
to `npm run dev` in your `package.json`.
Since nexd spawns `npm run dev` under the hood,
this ensures a seamless experience.

## Reset Script

Each Nexd app initialized using `create-nexd-app` is a clone of this website,
including documentation pages. Running:

```bash
// .Terminal
npm run reset
```

will reset the newly created app to a bare template, ready for you to start building.
